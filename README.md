###  in my journey of learning python which the best tool for data science i found a youtube channel  which is popular that have great open-source lectures from MIT which you can find by just putting the title in youtube search bar .... but as a viewer of this useful channel i found that it takes lots of time to grasp the whole content of a video form handouts to essential content and going back and forth from my notebook "IDE"  to the video ...... So i decided as a remote student of this course to share my summarized version of the course as a notebook for every lecture  
___
___


####  as the main lecturer said 
###  "this course is not exactly a python course it's a computer science course and python is merely a learning tool"     
###   Well, i find that's ture myself because of  the great Algorithms and Scientific methods that you learn in this course

### this Summary is not to be an alternative of the original course .... if you are in a hurry it will be a great help
### this summary is not to neglect any essential part of the course eiher

### the summary will contain python 3.8 compatible code .... but you will find the original code from lectures and recitations commented throughout the notebook 


## Lecturers & TAs

### The main lecturer of the course is..... Prof. John Guttag 
###  Prof.  Eric Grimson  
###   And Three Great TAs who  i , unfortunately do not remember their names
